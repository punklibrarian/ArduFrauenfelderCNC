=============================
Copyright 2011 Design Tech Industries (DTI)  & Tamworth Hackerspace

In the 'mill' folder of this repository you will find the design files for the physical mill.
You will be able to use the 3D model of the mill and will be available in either SKP, DXF or STL 
format, most likely all three. You can find the SketchUp models in the 'sketchup_models' folder.

The physical mill is being designed to be manufactured by Ponoko (http://ponoko.com) and as such 
the actual production files for the mill will be made available in SVG and EPS formats. You will 
find the files needed in the 'laser cutting' folder. You will also find the faces exported from 
SketchUp, which are used to create the templates in the 'laser cutting' folder, in the 
'sketchup_exported_faces' folder.

**The SKP, SVG and EPS files currently in this repository are, like the controller board, in 
beta versioning and as such are not ready for actual production. They are merely here for public 
critique, i.e: If you see something wrong, or you think I could be doing something better, then let 
me know.**

You will also find a manual in the 'docs' folder for the assembly of the mill, with colour photos and diagrams.
