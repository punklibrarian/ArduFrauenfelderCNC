Copyright 2011 Design Tech Industries (DTI)  & Tamworth Hackerspace

In the 'Mill' folder of this repository you will find the design files for the physical mill.
You will be able to use the 3D model of the mill and will be available in either SKP, DXF or STL 
format, most likely all three.

The physical mill is being designed to be manufactured by Ponoko (http://ponoko.com) and as such 
the actual production files for the mill will be made available in EPS format.

You will also find a manual for the assembly of the mill, which includes the construction of the 
physical mill and it's controller board.
