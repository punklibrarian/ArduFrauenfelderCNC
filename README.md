The ArduFrauenfelderCNC is an Arduino compatible custom board with 
stepper motor drivers, running grbl.

Features:

 * ATmega328 MCU
 * SparkFun EasyDriver v4.4
 * Power LED & Reset switch
 * Populated pins for FTDI breakout board
 * Open Source, including commercial use (read license)

The "docs" folder within this repository includes a handy copy of the
schematic in PDF format and images of the pcb.

In this repository you will find the project (.pro), board (.brd) and schematic (.sch), 
along with a grbl file configured for the board.

**At the moment there is only the project, schematic and board files as it is an ongoing 
endeavour to create the board satisfactorily. If you can help in this regard please 
contact me, as well as if you find something that needs correction**
